# Introduction to Metaprogramming

Ruby has impressive _metaprogramming_ capabilities. A traditional program is
mainly code that manipulates a data structure and produces output, but
metaprogramming allows us to essentially write code that writes code.
Metaprogramming with Ruby, one can do in a few minutes what other languages may
take hours to do. By cleverly planning your code and applying the techniques
mentioned here, youâ€™ll be able to write code that is DRYer, lighter, more
intuitive and more scalable.

In this section we'll be discussing and working through some metaprogramming
concepts such as:

* Mass assignment
* Keyword arguments
* Creating custom errors and using them

Ruby's metaprogramming features offer a lot of functionality. You could, in
theory, write everything from scratch yourself, but doing that is very
inefficient. In this section of lessons and labs, we'll reveal how
metaprogramming makes sense, and is very needed in many situations.
